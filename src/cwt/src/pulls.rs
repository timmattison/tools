//! Open pull requests, read from the output of `gh pr list`.
//!
//! `cwt` shows the numbers of the open pull requests after the branch of a
//! worktree. One `gh pr list --json` call for each repository gives all the
//! data. This module holds the pure part of that work: it reads the URL of a
//! remote, and it reads the JSON that `gh` prints. It runs no command and it
//! needs no network, so every rule in it has an offline test.
