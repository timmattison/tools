# gitscratch

The hardened harness for dry-running a git operation without touching anything
real.

Answering "would this rebase conflict, and how badly?" means actually performing
the rebase, and performing it means running git against the developer's own
repository. That is only safe because of a specific set of pinned settings. This
crate owns them, so that every tool asking that question inherits the same
guarantees instead of each reimplementing a weaker version.

## The interface

```rust
use gitscratch::Scratch;

// A detached worktree at `main`, in a temp directory, torn down on drop.
let scratch = Scratch::create(repo_path, "main")?;

// Check the candidate out detached, then replay it.
scratch.git().run(&["checkout", "-q", "--detach", "feature"])?;
let conflicts = scratch.replay_rebase("main")?;

println!(
    "{} hunks across {} files, {} stops",
    conflicts.hunks(),
    conflicts.files(),
    conflicts.stops()
);
```

`Scratch` is the only door in. It hands out a `Git` that already carries the
whole safety configuration, so there is no way to get a worktree from here
without also getting the hardening — which is the point.

A replay walks the *whole* operation rather than bailing at the first collision,
resolving as it goes by staging the conflict markers verbatim. That is the
conservative auto-resolution: unlike `--ours` or `--theirs` it never silently
discards a side. It does mean a later commit touching the same region conflicts
again, which is faithful to reality, since a human resolution also leaves later
commits conflicting against the resolved state. Treat a `Conflicts` as a cost
index measured under identical rules, not as an exact prediction.

## What it guarantees

| Guard | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `rebase.updateRefs=false` | Without it, rebasing a detached HEAD still rewrites every branch ref pointing into the replayed range — including the branch being simulated. Not paranoia: with the setting enabled and the guard removed, a dry run *destroys the branch it is replaying*. |
| `rerere.enabled=false`, `rerere.autoupdate=false` | A simulated resolution would otherwise land in the shared `rr-cache` and silently pre-resolve the developer's real merges later. |
| `core.hooksPath` → an empty directory | No hook fires. An empty *value* is not "hooks off" — git still resolves lookups against it — so the path is a real, empty, temporary directory, validated once at creation. |
| `GIT_EDITOR`, `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR`, `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT` | A halted rebase would otherwise open an editor and hang forever. |
| `commit.gpgsign=false` | A signing config in the developer's global gitconfig would otherwise prompt or fail mid-replay. |
| `gc.auto=0` | Simulated commits are loose and nothing references them yet; an opportunistic gc could collect one out from under the run. |
| `rebase.autoStash=false`, `rebase.autosquash=false` | The replay must be the operation as written, not a rewritten variant of it. |

Teardown removes the scratch worktree **by path** and deliberately never runs
`git worktree prune`. Pruning is repo-wide and immediate: it deletes the
administrative state — including any halted rebase — of every worktree whose
directory is merely *missing right now*, which is the normal condition for a
worktree on an unmounted drive or a sleeping network mount. A dry run must not
cost the developer a worktree.

## Testing

`tests/safety.rs` pins three properties today, each verified by mutation —
remove the guard, watch that specific test fail, put it back:

- **`rebase.updateRefs=false`**, the first row above, asserted with the setting
  deliberately turned *on* in the repository being replayed.
- **The detached checkout**, which is what lets a branch already checked out in
  another worktree be replayed at all. It is spelled out in the test rather than
  hidden behind a library call precisely because it is a guard.
- **The absence of `git worktree prune` in teardown.** This one is mutated in
  the opposite direction — *add* a prune and watch the test fail — because the
  guarantee is that it is not there.

A unit test in `src/git.rs` pins the identity scratch commits are authored
under, so they are attributable to this crate rather than to whichever tool is
driving it.

The remaining rows of the table above — the `rerere` pair, `core.hooksPath`, the
editor and prompt environment, `commit.gpgsign`, `gc.auto`, and the
`rebase.autoStash`/`autosquash` pair — are established by construction in
`safety_config` and are **not yet covered by a test**. Issue #329 tracks growing
the suite to eight guarantees and mutation-verifying every guard; when it lands,
this paragraph goes with it.

Consumers pin what they compose on top of the harness. `grist`'s own
`tests/safety.rs` asserts that a full simulation — its `checkout --detach` →
`replay_rebase` → `squash_into` sequence, which this crate's tests cannot see —
leaves every real branch ref where it found it.

The `testing` feature exposes `gitscratch::testing`: throwaway git repositories
with known conflict shapes, shared by every crate built on the harness so the
fixtures exist once rather than once per test binary. Every fixture lives in its
own `TempDir`, so concurrent `cargo test` runs never share a path.

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
gitscratch = { workspace = true, features = ["testing"] }
```
