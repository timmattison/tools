//! The board: the runs of all watched repositories, as rows for one screen.
//!
//! The board holds the last good runs of each repository, the last error of
//! each repository, the time window, the selection, and the scroll offset.
//! It does no I/O. Every reader takes the current time as an argument, so a
//! test uses one fixed time and never reads the clock.
