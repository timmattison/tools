# ShellCheck configuration for Buffalo Tools
# https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/

# Enable all checks by default (no disabled rules)
# This ensures we catch:
# - SC2002: Useless use of cat (UUOC)
# - SC2086: Double quote to prevent word splitting
# - SC2046: Quote to prevent word splitting/globbing
# - And many other common shell script issues

# Use bash as the default shell
shell=bash

# External sources (scripts sourced with . or source) are allowed
external-sources=true
